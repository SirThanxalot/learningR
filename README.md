# learningR
This repository isto be used for my **R language** learning sessions.

What are you waiting for? Check out [here](https://github.com/SirThanxalot) my brand new [profile in Gitub!
You'll be amazed by:
* how empty it is
* how full it isn't
* and how it generally is as the previous two bullet points described it



> [!NOTE]
> Changes I did include: this note, a link leading to my own profile in Github and that "R language" is in **bold** now
